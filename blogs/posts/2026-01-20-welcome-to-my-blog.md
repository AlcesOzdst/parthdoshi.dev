# Welcome to My Blog! 

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my corner of the internet where I'll be sharing my journey through the world of cybersecurity and web development.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Cybersecurity**: Latest vulnerabilities, security best practices, and ethical hacking insights
- **Web Development**: Modern frameworks, CSS tricks, and building cool projects
- **CTF Writeups**: Detailed walkthroughs of Capture The Flag challenges
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for security tools and techniques

## Why I Started This Blog

As a student passionate about both building and breaking things, I wanted a place to document my learning journey. Whether you're a fellow security enthusiast or just curious about tech, I hope you find something useful here.

## Stay Tuned

More content coming soon! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or topics you'd like me to cover.

Happy hacking! 🔐
